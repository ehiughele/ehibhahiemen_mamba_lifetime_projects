# 🐍 Mamba Engineering — 100-Day Blueprint  
**A Director-Track Portfolio in Data Engineering, Analytics Engineering & Cloud Architecture**

Welcome to the **Mamba Engineering Portfolio**, a structured collection of hands-on projects, notes, and systems designed during a 100-day accelerated mastery program (Dec 2025 → March 2026).  
This repository is a reflection of **discipline, consistency, and continuous improvement** inspired by the Mamba Mentality.

The goal of this portfolio is to build **deep expertise** across:  
- **Databricks (Spark, Delta Lake, Medallion)**  
- **DBT (Analytics Engineering, testing, documentation)**  
- **Microsoft Fabric (Lakehouse, Warehouse, Pipelines, Governance)**  
- **Azure Data Engineering (DP-203 track)**  
- **Architecture & Systems Thinking (DDIA)**  
- **CI/CD, DevOps, and GitHub Actions**  
- **Python, SQL, Spark Optimization**
